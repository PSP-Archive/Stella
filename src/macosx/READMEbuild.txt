current release is linked against version 1.2.8 for MacOSX.  The SDL framework 
may be located else where, but the project include and copy framework settings 
would need to be changed.

The second library which the application is linked libpng.  The library source
may be downloaded from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html.  I am

   libpng.a
   png.h
   pngconf.h

<body>
<p>Stella 2.0 contains support for Bob Colbert's Cheetah cheat codes, as
well as an extended Stella-specific type of cheat code that works on
bankswitched ROMs.</p>

<p>To enter a cheat code, press Ctrl-C during emulation to bring up
the Cheat dialog, and enter your code there. Press Enter when done,
or Escape to abort if you change your mind.</p>

<p>Cheetah codes are explained in detail on Bob Colbert's web page, along
with a list of codes for various games:</p>

<p><a href="http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/">http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/</a></p>

<p>Briefly:</p>

<pre>
   6-digit (cheetah) code: aaaddc
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1
</pre>

<p>Cheetah codes don't support bankswitched ROMs, so they only work for
2K or 4K ROMs.</p>

<p>Stella's extended cheats are similar to Cheetah codes, except that
they can be 7 or 8 digits long, with the extra digits used for the
bank number:</p>

<pre>
   7-digit (stella) code: baaaddc
   b = bank (0 to $f)
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1

   8-digit (stella) code: bbaaaddc
   bb = bank (0 to $ff)
   aaa = address - $f000
   dd = data
   c = count - 1
</pre>

<p>Here are a few cheat codes I've found:</p>

<pre>
Pitfall (standard Cheetah codes):
   5b0ea1 - infinite lives
   723ea1 - infinite time
   aa5??0 - set starting level, ?? = 01 to ff (d0 is kinda neat)

Battlezone (Stella extended codes):
   1236ea1 - infinite lives

Ms Pac-Man (Stella extended codes):
   108fea1 - infinite lives
</pre>

<p>The next release of Stella (2.1 or 3.0) will contain a much nicer
user interface for managing cheat codes, along with a database
of cheats.  If you've found any new cheats, please send them to me
(atari@hardcoders.org), so I can include them in the database. Ideally,
I'd like to collect at least infinite lives/time cheats for every
game listed in stella.pro.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

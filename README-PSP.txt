Known Bugs
----------
    o SDL video driver is in early stage, so expect flickering and update problems
    o Stella will only compile/run with lastest sdl, pspskd and toolchain.
    o Stella will crash if SDL is compiled with --disable-stdio-redirect.
      Also you need a custom libSDLmain which has a debugHandler for stdout.
